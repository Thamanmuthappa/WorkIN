# Introduction

WorkIN is designed to allow users to easily and efficiently do their fitness regimes inside their homes. Users would be able to carry out their routines without any need of external training/help.

# About WorkIN
We use pose estimation models using tensorflow.js and feed them into ml5.js allowing characterization 
teh yoga postures and then cross examine the poses with the current indivduals posture and allow the timer to start if and only if the correct posture is achieved. Transition from one yoga pose to another following the yoga routine.



# Features
We are using tensorflow.js and running data samples on ml5.js models, After data training using the cutom pose estimation models, we cross verify the current posture of the individual with it and allow the clock to run if the posture is correct. 



# Buisness Model
Due to the ongoing pandemic, a lot of gyms and other means of exercise have been shut down, this had led to people losing shape and becoming unhealthy. We at WorkIN, aim to solve this problem with this simple application using which the user can figure out if he/she is doing an exercise routine properly without the need of a personal trainer.
We also aim to keep several analytical tools to help the user figure out, in what areas, he/she needs, to work upon.
From a financial standpoint users could pay a nominal monthly or yearly subscription to make use of our services.
